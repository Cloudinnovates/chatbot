# chatbot

I'm making a native JS bot that could be used as a way to guide you through a website.

I started this as a little project for my portfolio, but it turned into a school project aswell.

The bot works by checking the input a user creates.
Once the bot knows what input is given, it will check if the input is the same as one of the pre programmed commands.
If that's the case then the bot will output what corresponds the input.
If the input is not a command then the bot will output something like: "I didn't quite get that"

***
Current commands with outputs:
- help
- about
- best work
- vision
- experience
- CV
- hobbies or interests
- contact
- rick roll (just try it)

***
Things I still want to add:
- //Fixed on Jan 8// Sentence recognition
- //Fixed on Jan 8// Using functions as output (to redirect people on my website)
- //Fixed// Being able to conversate by outputting a question on which you could respond again.
- Sentences with more than one command
- Some easter eggs like jokes and gifs as output

***
Known bugs:
- When output has an image the automatic down scrolling breaks
- Double commands outputs both outputs
